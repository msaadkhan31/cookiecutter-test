What's this folder for?
=======================

We provide a central set of deployment scripts to cover the most common use cases and functionality
for building and deploying your service, however, there are always edge cases we can't cover
because they're too specific to one or two services in a team.

This folder is where you can place the needed scripts to automate those non-standard steps so
you can use them from your Makefile

You can remove this README file if you wish
